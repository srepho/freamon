# Freamon Development: Next Steps

## Project Status

Freamon is a comprehensive package for data science and machine learning on tabular data. Current version: 0.2.0

The package has recently completed several major features:
- Pipeline system with visualization and persistence
- Data drift detection and monitoring
- ShapIQ integration for feature engineering and explainability
- Advanced category encoders (binary, hashing, WOE)
- LightGBM optimizations and hyperparameter tuning
- Model calibration and importance calculations
- Documentation and examples for all new features

## Priority Development Tasks

Based on the roadmap and current status, here are the next development priorities:

### 1. EDA Module Enhancements

- **Multivariate Analysis**
  - Implement PCA visualization for high-dimensional data
  - Add correlation networks for identifying feature clusters
  - Create interactive heatmaps for feature interactions

- **Time Series EDA**
  - Add seasonality detection
  - Implement decomposition plots (trend, seasonal, residual)
  - Add autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation visualizations

### 2. Feature Selection Methods

- **Filter Methods**
  - Implement chi-square feature selection for categorical features
  - Add ANOVA F-value selection for regression problems

- **Wrapper Methods**
  - Implement recursive feature elimination (RFE)
  - Add forward/backward selection methods

- **Embedded Methods**
  - Implement Lasso and Ridge Regression based feature selection
  - Add regularization-based feature selection for tree models

### 3. Large Dataset Handling

- **Chunking Mechanisms**
  - Implement streaming data processing for large datasets
  - Add chunk-based processing for memory-intensive operations

- **Distributed Processing**
  - Add Dask integration for large-scale data processing
  - Implement parallel processing for intensive operations

### 4. AutoML Capabilities

- **Automatic Hyperparameter Optimization**
  - Expand existing LightGBM tuning to other models
  - Implement pipeline-level optimization

- **Model Selection**
  - Add automatic model selection based on problem type
  - Implement ensemble methods for combining multiple models

### 5. Quality Improvements

- **Testing**
  - Fix failing tests in test suite
  - Improve test coverage for new features
  - Add integration tests for complete workflows

- **Documentation**
  - Complete documentation for all modules
  - Add more examples showcasing feature combinations
  - Create tutorials for common workflows

## Bug Fixes and Technical Debt

- Fix tests failing in feature selection and model training steps
- Address issues in pipeline visualization
- Resolve compatibility issues with latest pandas version (use `isinstance` instead of deprecated `is_categorical_dtype`)
- Fix ShapIQ integration issues when library is not available

## Release Planning

### Version 0.2.x Patches

- Version 0.2.1: Fix failing tests and known bugs
- Version 0.2.2: Address technical debt and improve documentation

### Version 0.3.0

- Implement EDA module enhancements
- Add feature selection methods
- Improve large dataset handling

### Version 0.4.0

- Add AutoML capabilities
- Implement ensemble methods
- Add web-based dashboard for exploration
