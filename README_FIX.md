# Freamon EDA Currency Symbol Fix

## Overview
This document explains the fixes implemented in version 0.3.16 to address issues with the EDA module when handling data containing currency symbols and other special characters that matplotlib can misinterpret as LaTeX commands.

## The Problem
Matplotlib, by default, interprets certain characters as LaTeX math mode delimiters:
- `$` symbols trigger math mode
- `_` characters are interpreted as subscripts
- `^` characters are interpreted as superscripts
- Other characters like `%`, `\`, `{`, `}` have special meaning

This causes errors when generating plots and HTML reports with data containing these symbols, especially financial data with currency symbols.

## The Solution
Version 0.3.16 implements a comprehensive set of patches to make freamon robust when handling currency symbols and other special characters:

1. **Matplotlib Text Rendering Patches**:
   - Patches matplotlib's text rendering functions to safely handle special characters
   - Preprocesses text to avoid LaTeX interpretation of currency symbols
   - Adds error handling to gracefully recover from rendering failures

2. **EDA Module Error Handling**:
   - Makes the `run_full_analysis` method more robust with proper exception handling
   - Allows analysis to continue even if certain steps encounter errors
   - Provides meaningful error messages instead of crashing

3. **HTML Report Generation**:
   - Adds fallback mechanism to generate minimal reports when errors occur
   - Fixes accordion component functionality
   - Ensures safe processing of all text displayed in reports

## Usage
To use the fixed version with your code:

```python
# Option 1: Import and use the comprehensive patches directly
from freamon.utils.matplotlib_fixes import apply_comprehensive_matplotlib_patches, patch_freamon_eda

# Apply the patches before running any analysis
apply_comprehensive_matplotlib_patches()
patch_freamon_eda()

# Now run your analysis as usual
from freamon.eda.analyzer import EDAAnalyzer
analyzer = EDAAnalyzer(df, target_column='target')
report = analyzer.run_full_analysis()
```

See the example in `examples/eda_with_currency.py` for a complete demonstration.

## Benefits
- No more crashes when working with financial data containing currency symbols
- Improved error handling and recovery throughout the EDA process
- More robust HTML report generation
- Better visualization of text containing special characters
