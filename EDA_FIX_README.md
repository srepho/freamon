# Freamon EDA Report Fix

## Issue
The Freamon EDA module was experiencing crashes when generating reports containing currency symbols, special characters, and other values that could be misinterpreted as LaTeX math delimiters by matplotlib.

## Solution
This fix implements comprehensive patches to make the Freamon EDA report generation more robust:

1. **Enhanced matplotlib patches**:
   - Fixed text rendering in the Agg backend to safely handle problematic characters
   - Patched mathtext parser to prevent crashes on parsing errors
   - Added preprocessing for text that contains special characters
   - Applied monkey patches to seaborn and matplotlib text handling functions

2. **Error-resilient EDA analyzer**:
   - Modified `run_full_analysis` to continue analysis even if some steps fail
   - Added try/except blocks around each analysis step
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for error conditions

3. **Improved HTML report generation**:
   - Added preprocessing of all text data before rendering
   - Created fallback minimal report generation for severe errors
   - Fixed accordion functionality in HTML reports

## Usage

To apply the fixes in your code, simply add these lines at the beginning of your script:

```python
from configure_matplotlib_for_currency import patch_freamon

# Apply the patches to make EDA more robust
patch_freamon()

# Now use freamon as usual
from freamon.eda import EDAAnalyzer
analyzer = EDAAnalyzer(df)
analyzer.run_full_analysis(output_path='robust_eda_report.html')
```

## Testing

A test script (`test_eda_fix.py`) is provided to verify the fixes. It creates a DataFrame with potentially problematic values (currency symbols, underscores, etc.) and runs an EDA analysis on it.

To run the test:

```bash
python test_eda_fix.py
```

## File Modifications

The following files were modified or created:

1. `freamon/utils/matplotlib_fixes.py` - Enhanced with comprehensive patches
2. `configure_matplotlib_for_currency.py` - Updated with new patching function
3. `test_eda_fix.py` - Created to test the fixes

## Technical Details

The fixes address several specific issues:

1. **Dollar sign handling**: Preprocesses text to replace `$` with `[DOLLAR]` to prevent LaTeX math mode interpretation
2. **Underscore handling**: Replaces `_` with `[UNDERSCORE]` to prevent subscript interpretation
3. **LaTeX parsing errors**: Adds error handling to gracefully recover from parsing failures
4. **HTML report generation**: Ensures all text is safe before generating HTML reports
5. **Error recovery**: Implements fallback mechanisms to continue analysis even if some steps fail

These fixes make the EDA module much more robust when working with data containing special characters, currency symbols, and other potentially problematic values.
